# IoT-arduino-DHT11 Sensor

This repository contains an Arduino setup designed to collect data from sensors, with a focus on temperature and humidity readings displayed via the serial monitor.

## Description

Here, we've created a system using the DHT11 sensor and Arduino Uno to monitor temperature and humidity within a given space.

## Components

- Arduino Uno
- Temperature Sensor (TMP36)
- Potentiometer
- Breadboard

## Documentation

The DHT11 sensor is widely used for measuring temperature and humidity, making it ideal for prototypes aimed at monitoring ambient conditions.

These sensors can measure temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 degrees Celsius with an accuracy of ±2 degrees Celsius. Additionally, they can measure humidity levels from 20% to 90% with an accuracy of ±5% relative humidity (RH).
