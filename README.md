 # Documentation
   The DHT11 serves as a widely employed temperature and humidity sensor, particularly beneficial for prototypes aimed at monitoring ambient temperature and humidity levels within an area.

These sensors have the capability to measure temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 degrees Celsius, with an accuracy of (+ or -) 2 degrees Celsius. Additionally, they can measure humidity levels from 20% to 90% with an accuracy of (+ or -) 5% relative humidity (RH).
