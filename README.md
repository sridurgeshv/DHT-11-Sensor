# DHT11 Sensor

 # Description
      Here we are working with the dht11 sensor based on the arduino uno to check the temperature and humidity in the room.
      
 # Components
    Arduino Uno. 
    Temperature Sensor [TMP 36].
    Potentiometer.
    Bread Board.
   
 # Documentation
   The DHT 11 is a commonly used Temperature and Humidity sensor for prototypes monitoring the ambient temperature and humidity of a given area.
   
  The sensors can measure temperature from 0 to 50 degree C with an accuracy at (+ or -)2 degree C and humidity from 20% to 90% with an accuracy at (+ or -)5% RH relative humidity.
