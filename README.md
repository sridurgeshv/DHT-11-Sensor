# IoT-arduino-DHT11 Sensor
  Here the arduino that reads data from sensors* (temperature and humidity in this case) and displays it on the serial monitor.
 # Description
  <em>Here we are working with the dht11 sensor based on the arduino uno to check the temperature and humidity in the room</em>. 
      
 # Components
    Arduino Uno. 
    Temperature Sensor [TMP 36].
    Potentiometer.
    Bread Board.
   
 # Documentation
   The DHT 11 is a commonly used Temperature and Humidity sensor for prototypes monitoring the ambient temperature and humidity of a given area.
   
  The sensors can measure temperature from 0 to 50 degree C with an accuracy at (+ or -)2 degree C and humidity from 20% to 90% with an accuracy at (+ or -)5% RH relative humidity.
